Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer, meaning players compete against the dealer but not against other players. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:

Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), without a dealer blackjack; 

Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21; 

or Let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand exceeds 21.

The code developed for this game also records behavior information from both players, and store it in a textfile.
